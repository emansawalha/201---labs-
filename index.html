         <hr />
         <h2>Career Objective</h2>
     <p> I am looking to work in dynamic and challenging environment, where I can prove myself
            As a competent employee and a valuable asset to the company I work for and put the knowledge
           I gain through studying and working into action.
           
           Through the process of working and studying I found myself a very dedicated worker and can work under Pressure, plus having a huge ability to learn each and every day. I’ve worked with teams and manage teams. Though I can be self-motivated and manage to work alone.
